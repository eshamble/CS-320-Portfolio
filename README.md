CS-320 - Software Test, Automation

    How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Functional- test for every requirement, and try to get 100% coverage. Manually test the code to make sure the user experience makes sense, if applicable.
Secure- This is less applicable to this class, but in CS-305, we went over input validation, APIs, cryptography, client/server, code error, code quality, and encapsulation as considerations. If any of those are applicable, they should be checked.


    How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Address all the needs that I know of, and address anything I can think of afterwards. Requirements aren't everything- I need to think about the spirit of the requirement, not just the requirement itself. There are some thing sthat are common sense that I can work into my implementation- like intuitive UX design.


    How do I approach designing software?
I try to approach it with the user's needs and ease of coding in mind. I try my best to check off every requirement, while making sure that my code makes sense and is easy to modify and read. I do my best to avoid redundant code within the parameters of my task (I couldn't do it as much as I would have liked, if the project had less strict requirements on which files to submit. Task, Appointment, and Contact could have used a superclass.
